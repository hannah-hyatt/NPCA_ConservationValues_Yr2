# * NOTE: Please make a copy of this script before editing and/or running.
# * The script loops through the final "hypergrid" rasters that show which species' models fall within each pixel,
#   clips these rasters to a specified boundary, and exports the species lists as dbf files.
# * Once this script is complete, the R script "ExtractUniqueSpeciesList.R needs to be run in order
#   to extract all unique species' cutecodes to a single csv file
# * 3 variables need to be updated by the user:
#   1) boundary: Folder containing boundaries to clip the hypergrid rasters
#   2) outTemp: Geodatabase to contain temporary raster files
#   3) outWS: output workpace folder
