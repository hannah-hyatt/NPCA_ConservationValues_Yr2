# IUCN analysis for study areas
# Before this script:
# flattened PADUS layer was unioned to Study Areas which were unioned to CONUS (CONUS_AnalysisLayer below)
# Flags for inside/outside of study areas (field = "StudyArea"), managed/unmanaged lands (field = "managed"), protected/unprotected lands(field = "prot")
# merged flags with GAP status or Manager Name and name of study areas in format fitting for R code (location of R code here)

# Details on script below:
# Tabulate area for the field which outlines if the lands are protected, what status of protection they hold, and if it falls inside or outside of study areas.
# Tabulate area for the field which outlinse if the lands are managed, who is the land manager (Manager Name), and if it falls inside or outisde of study areas.

# Outputs:
# to be used in R code which creates bar chart visual of the above.
